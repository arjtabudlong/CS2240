          <h2>Biography</h2>
          <h5>Early Life</h5>
          <p>
            José Rizal was born on June 19, 1861 to Francisco Rizal Mercado y
            Alejandro and Teodora Alonso Realonda y Quintos in the town of
            Calamba in Laguna province. He had nine sisters and one brother. His
            parents were leaseholders of a hacienda and an accompanying rice
            farm held by the Dominicans.
          </p>
          <h5>Spain</h5>
          <p>
            Upon his return to Manila in 1892, he formed a civic movement called
            La Liga Filipina. The league advocated these moderate social reforms
            through legal means, but was disbanded by the governor. At that
            time, he had already been declared an enemy of the state by the
            Spanish authorities because of the publication of his novel.
          </p>
          <h5>Rebellion</h5>
          <p>
            By 1896, the rebellion fomented by the Katipunan, a militant secret
            society, had become a full-blown revolution, proving to be a
            nationwide uprising.[59][self-published source?] Rizal had earlier
            volunteered his services as a doctor in Cuba and was given leave by
            Governor-General Ramón Blanco to serve in Cuba to minister to
            victims of yellow fever. Rizal and Josephine left Dapitan on August
            1, 1896, with letter of recommendation from Blanco. Rizal was
            arrested en route to Cuba via Spain and was imprisoned in Barcelona
            on October 6, 1896. He was sent back the same day to Manila to stand
            trial as he was implicated in the revolution through his association
            with members of the Katipunan. During the entire passage, he was
            unchained, no Spaniard laid a hand on him, and had many
            opportunities to escape but refused to do so.
