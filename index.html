                Jose Rizal, born on June 19, 1861, in Calamba, Laguna,
                Philippines, was a polymath, nationalist, and one of the most
                prominent figures in the Philippine Revolution against Spanish
                colonial rule.
                <br />
                <br />
              </p>
              <p>
                He received his early education in Calamba and later attended
                the Ateneo Municipal de Manila for his secondary education
                before pursuing medicine at the University of Santo Tomas and
                Philosophy and Letters at the Universidad Central de Madrid.
                Rizal's exposure to European liberalism and nationalism, as well
                as his experiences of discrimination in Spanish colonial
                society, influenced his nationalist sentiments, leading him to
                write his first novel, "Noli Me Tangere" (Touch Me Not), which
                criticized the Spanish friars and colonial administration in the
                Philippines. <br />
                <br />
              </p>

              <p>
                Upon returning to the Philippines in 1887, he founded the La
                Liga Filipina, advocating for political reforms and equality,
                but was subsequently arrested and exiled to Dapitan in Mindanao
                in 1892. During his exile, he continued his scientific and
                literary pursuits, establishing a school, practicing medicine,
                and contributing to various fields of knowledge. He also wrote
                his second novel, "El Filibusterismo" (The Reign of Greed),
                which further criticized Spanish abuses and corruption. Though
                initially hesitant about armed rebellion, Rizal supported the
                Philippine Revolution when the Katipunan began an uprising
                against Spanish rule in 1896. However, his efforts to seek
                reforms through peaceful means were unsuccessful, and he was
                arrested and tried by a Spanish military court, ultimately being
                found guilty of rebellion, sedition, and conspiracy. <br />
                <br />
              </p>

              <p>
                On December 30, 1896, he was executed by firing squad in Manila,
                sparking outrage among Filipinos and further fueling the
                revolution. Jose Rizal's martyrdom galvanized the Philippine
                Revolution, leading to the eventual independence of the
                Philippines from Spanish colonial rule. He is celebrated as a
                national hero, and his writings, particularly his novels,
                continue to be studied as foundational texts in Philippine
                literature. Rizal's ideas of nationalism, reform, and education
                remain influential in Philippine society, inspiring generations
                of Filipinos.

            <div class="par">
              <p>
                "Noli Me Tangere" is a novel written by Jose Rizal, published in
                1887, during the Spanish colonial period in the Philippines. The
                title, Latin for "Touch Me Not," is derived from the Gospel of
                John in the Bible. The novel is a social commentary that exposes
                the abuses of the Spanish friars and the injustices under
                colonial rule. It follows the story of Crisostomo Ibarra, a
                young Filipino returning from Europe, as he navigates the
                corrupt and oppressive society of his homeland. Through its
                characters and plot, "Noli Me Tangere" sheds light on various
                issues such as colonial exploitation, social inequality,
                religious hypocrisy, and the need for reform. The novel sparked
                controversy and was met with resistance from Spanish
                authorities, but it also inspired nationalist sentiments among
                Filipinos and contributed to the awakening of Filipino
                consciousness. Today, "Noli Me Tangere" is considered a seminal
                work in Philippine literature and is often studied in schools
                for its historical significance and its enduring relevance to
                Philippine society.

            <h5>El Filibusterismo</h5>
            <div class="par">
              <p>
                "El Filibusterismo" is the second novel written by Jose Rizal,
                published in 1891 as a sequel to his earlier work, "Noli Me
                Tangere." The title, Spanish for "The Reign of Greed" or "The
                Subversive," reflects the darker and more revolutionary tone of
                the novel compared to its predecessor. Set in the Philippines
                under Spanish colonial rule, "El Filibusterismo" continues the
                narrative of the characters introduced in "Noli Me Tangere" and
                delves deeper into the themes of social injustice, oppression,
                and the struggle for reform. The protagonist, Crisostomo Ibarra,
                returns under the guise of Simoun, a wealthy jeweler, seeking
                revenge against the corrupt ruling class and plotting a
                revolution to overthrow the colonial regime. Through its vivid
                portrayal of Filipino society and its scathing critique of
                Spanish abuses, "El Filibusterismo" serves as a powerful
                indictment of colonialism and exploitation. Today, "El
                Filibusterismo" is studied alongside its predecessor as a
                cornerstone of Philippine literature and as a testament to
                Rizal's enduring influence on Filipino nationalism and identity.
